3. **Robust Back-End Integration:**  
   - Node.js and Express.js powering efficient server-side operations  
   - MongoDB’s flexible, document-based storage adapts to diverse data structures  
   - Real-time data synchronization for up-to-the-minute information

4. **Enhanced Security:**  
   - Role-based access control to protect sensitive information  
   - Encrypted data transmission and storage  
   - Regular security updates to safeguard against potential vulnerabilities
